# What is GenFa?

<p>It's a <i>full-stack application</i> built with the <strong>MERN Stack</strong>.</p>
<p>It was mainly developed for an institution that was struggling with the creation of invoices, linking them to people, storing the data in a database, and maintaining a record history.</p>

## What features the app brings?

- The application allows two kinds of users: **Invoice-Maker** and **Invoice-Receiver**.
- An **Invoice-Maker** is allowed to see the **Invoice Form component** in which the data of the **Invoice-Receivers** will be displayed and applied to generate the invoices.
- After inputting the data, the **Invoice-Maker** can review the invoice:

- When clicking on the "Descargar Copia" button, the data will be stored in the database and automatically generate a PDF that serves as the invoice where the data is displayed:

- The **Invoice-Maker** can also visualize a record history of the invoices created on the account and filter them by Date, Name, or Reason.

- As an **Invoice-Receiver** you can view all the invoices generated and linked to your account:

## What have I learned on this project?

- I consolidated my abilities using React and fetching data from APIs and databases.
- It gave me confidence in applying Bootstrap to stylize the views.
- The importances of directory architecture and conventions to have an organized project.
- I gained confidence in dealing with clients and their real problems.
